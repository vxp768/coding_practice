/*
 Addition: new element is added at end, then that element traverses upwards if bigger.
  * addition time could be O(1) to O(log N) in worst case when new elem has to 
  * traverse all the way to root.
 
 Delete is done by removing the last element in array as the property of 
 complete binary tree needs to be fulfilled.
