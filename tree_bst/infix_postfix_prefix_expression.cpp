/*
    Infix:    A+B       A+(B*C)
    Prefix:   +AB       +A*BC
    Postfix:  AB+       ABC*+
Only infix notation requires the additional symbols...parantheses
The order of operations within prefix and postfix expressions is completely 
determined by the position of the operator and nothing else.
In many ways, this makes infix the least desirable notation to use.
