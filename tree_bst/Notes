1. How to handle duplicates in BST?
A: option 1:  simply keep adding dups to the right

   option 2:  augment the node to keep count of how many times key was added.
              increment count for each add and decrement for each delete.
              This solution is better for AVL or RB tree as self-balancing can be taken care of easily.
              
By definition BST is for unique keys.
