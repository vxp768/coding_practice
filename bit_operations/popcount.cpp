/*
    Count number of bits set to 1 in any given word/integer

Usage:
 *  determine the size of the intersection or union between two bitsets.
        In such cases, we must first apply a logical operation on pairs of words (AND, OR) and then compute the
        population count of the resulting words. For example, the cardinality of the intersection of the sets A =
        {4, 5, 6, 7} and B = {1, 3, 5, 7} represented by the words 0xF0 and 0xAA can be computed as 
        |A âˆ© B| = popcount(0xF0 AND 0xAA) = popcount(0xA0) = 2.

 *  error correction: Hamming weight is Hamming distance, which is the number of differing positions between two strings of identical length. 
                      For two binary strings x and y, this is just the popcount of them XORed together.

/*
 * Subtracting 1 from a decimal number flips all the bits after the rightmost set bit(which is 1) including the rightmost set bit.
for example :
            10 in binary is 00001010
            9 in binary is 00001001
            8 in binary is 00001000
            7 in binary is 00000111
So if we subtract a number by 1 and do bitwise & with itself (n & (n-1)), we unset the rightmost set bit.
 If we do n & (n-1) in a loop and count the no of times loop executes we get the set bit count.
