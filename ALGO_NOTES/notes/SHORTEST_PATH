Graph G(V,E) 

Topological sort: works only for DAG…Graphs cannot have cycles but can have -ve edges.
After topological sort pick the source and relax all the edges in forward direction. 

Dijkstra’s algo: Graphs can have cycle but no -ve edges.
Relax each edge exactly once 
Edges are non-negative. 
Greedy algo. 
Dijkstra is sort of BFS and greedy combined since once vertex is selected we look at all adjacents and pick the one with minimum weight. 

Bellman-Ford:
Relax each edge |V| -1 times. 
Edges can have -ve weight. 
Can detect -ve weigth cycle. 

Floyd Warshall algo:
Dynamic programming.
