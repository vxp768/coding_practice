STL is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. 
It is a library of container classes, algorithms and iterators

STL has four components: 
	1.	Algorithms 

	2.	Containers 

	3.	Functions 

	4.	Iterators 


Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, etc. 
Containers:  
          Sequence containers: implement data structures which can be accessed in a sequential manner. 
                                              vector, list, deque, arrays, forward_list 

          Container adaptors: provide a different interface for sequential containers. 
                                              queue, priority_queue, stack 

          Associative containers: implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n)complexity) 
                                           set, multiset, map, multimap


Priority queues can be implemented by heaps, and heaps can be implemented by arrays.
